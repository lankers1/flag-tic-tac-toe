# flag-tic-tac-toe
### Background
This project started out as a means to learn Golang and websockets, a technology Iâ€™d never encountered professionally. I am a lover of Geography and gaming, so I combined these two to create Flag tic-tac-toe in an attempt to test my vexillological knowledge.

### Development
As my main focus was on learning about backend I wanted a lightweight frontend codebase, which led to my choice for Zustand over something like React-redux and choosing Sass instead of and alternative like tailwind CSS. Some frontend tooling used:
- Vite (inc. Esbuild) for development and bundling.
- Zustand for state management
- React-query for server state and fetching
- Sass, CSS preprocessor
- React-router
